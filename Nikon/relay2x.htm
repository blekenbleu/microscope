<h2>generic approx 2x photo relay lenses</h2>
<p>These typically have 23.2mm tube to fit microscopes and C-mount thread at their opposite end.<br />
Similar 0.5x photo relays are used with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016ODYIEK">C-mount USB camera cube</a>:<br />
<img width=640 src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fbzAzzXyL._AC_SL1000_.jpg" alt="Amazon 5mp USB" /><br />
Since Nikon CF objectives are nominally free of chromatic aberrations,<br />
truly generic photo relay camera adapters <em>could</em> work well.<br />
<a href="http://www.prc68.com/I/MicroPhotography.html#ISvO">Brooke Clarke compared a pair of generic camera adapters</a><br />
<img width=640 src="http://www.prc68.com/I/Images/RelayInb.jpg" alt="Image Solutions and Optexcom Camera Adapters" /><br />
which are no longer available from cited vendors Image Solutions and Optexcom.  <br />
A relay lens acquired 20 or so years ago looks similar to that Optexcom adapter:<br />
<img width=640 src="Images/generic20yr.jpg" alt="" /><br />
@ 5cm from C-mount thread to camera sensor, that image is poor and distorted,<br />
because it is actually intended for use with a C-mount camera sensor in very close proximity.</p>

<p>The Image Solutions adapter looks similar to currently-available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009OY7YG6">AmScope CA-CAN-SLR-III</a>.<br />
<img width=640 src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZtB9YrKkL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="AmScope CA-CAN-SLR-III" /><br />
Its Amazon price is higher than that for a used <a href="CFPL2.5X">CF PL2.5X</a>,<br />
but includes mechanical camera attachment that CF PL2.5X needs.</p>
