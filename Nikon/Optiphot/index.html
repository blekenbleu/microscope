<h2>Nikon Optiphot Microscope</h2>

The Optiphot was introduced around 1978, inheriting some features from 1976 Metaphot and Biophot,<br>
with the same <a href="../Metaphot/#CF">CF</a> optics but more options and some cost reductions, including lower illumination power.

<h4>Received 9 June 2022</h4></a>
Despite being advertised as a Labophot,
it is an Optiphot, as embossed on its "Nikon Optiphot" arm plate.<br>
Plastic base pads are fine.&nbsp; 
Those tend to be problematic on Optiphot 2...<br>
<br>
The lamphouse was thankfully intact, having been removed as requested.<br>
Bulb lights;&nbsp filament shows clearly in the field lens;&nbsp missing 45mm diffusion filter...<br>
A cheap substitute was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041V9IX4">ordered from Amazon</a>.
<img src="OpticalPath.jpg"><br clear=all>
<br>
Condenser carrier and rack are intact and working,
but neither coarse nor fine stage focus knobs work.<br>
<br>
Bizarrly, power connecton for 12V bulb uses 110VAC plug and receptacle:<br>
<img src="Optiphot_12VDC.jpg"><br clear=all>
...although they match those on page 10 of 
<a href="https://cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/sites/cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/files/nikon-optiphot-manual_0.pdf">the Optiphot instruction manual</a>.<br>
<br>
Condenser carrier and rack are seemingly identical to those on the diaphot Optiphot 66;<br>
unlike the 66, its stop actually prevents running off its pinion.<br>
That carrier design seems odd;&nbsp an upper U is rigid to the rack,
with a screw that anchors condensers to it,<br>
but a lower spring-loaded ring
with two adjusting screws that center condensers.<br>
<img src="bottom.jpg"><br clear=all>
<br>
Condenser and substage assemblies mount on a dovetail that<br>
is removable from the (broken) stage focus rack.<br>

<a name="FOCUS">
<h3>Focus</h3></a>
Optiphot-1 (or <a href="../Labophot/index.htm#Finefocus">Labophot-1</a>) fine focus differs from Optiphot-66:<br>
<li>Optiphot-66 has a single 26:6 planetary gear driven from its (fragile plastic) fine focus gear (13:3), 
<li>Optiphot-1 15:6 plastic gear train, driven by fine focus, drives its 20:6 planetary (25:3).<br>

<img src="FineFocus.jpg"><br clear=all>
    <i>left</i>: Optiphot-1 fine focus;&nbsp <i>right</i>: Optiphot-66 fine focus, with fine focus shaft<br>
<br>
Metal planetary gear's small cog sticks thru brass gearcase<br>
<img width=500 src=gearcase.jpg><br>
...to drive a first coarse focus coaxial sun gear,<br>
which smaller cog drives the coarse focus planetary gear,<br>
which small cog drive the coaxial focus pinion sun gear.<br>
<br>
This Optiphot-1 focus had been already fiddled, missing
its first coarse focus sun gear,<br>
and its brass planetary gearcase was only loosely threaded onto its coarse focus tube,<br> coaxial with fine focus shaft.<br>
After tightening, Optiphot coarse focus knobs had about 1mm end play,<br>
and grease viscosity fails to resist stage drift;&nbsp that rack runs in crossed bearings.<br>
<br>
The -66 coarse focus tube had an improvised retaining nut on the end without gears;&nbsp
<br> its brass planetary gearcase is still tightly threaded to its coarse focus tube.<br>
<br>
Both focus blocks are the same 70mm width, so presumably matching fine focus shaft lengths. <br>
See <a href="../Labophot/index.htm#FineFocus">Labophot Fine Focus</a> for gear repair details.<br>

<h3>Condensers</h3></a>
<a href="../../ZeissCondenser">Zeiss 0.9 flip-top condenser</a> has smaller (42) dovetail than Nikon (45mm);&nbsp;  got 
<a href="https://www.microbehunter.com/microscopy-forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=15701">some advice</a>.<br>
AO condensers have 48mm dovetail.<br>
Nikon swing-out condenser lacks working distance for 3mm epi plate over the stage.<br>
<a href="../ELWDcondenser/">ELWD condenser</a> arguably has too much working distance.<br>

A Nikon 5 space microscope turret that fits Microphot, Labophot and Optiphot for sure.<br>
It may fit other models.<br>
The turret is in excellent condition.<br>

Selling as is.  Focus has issues.  Power supply, lamp house, field diaphragm are working properly<br>
<br>
<i>received 9 May 2023</i><br>
<li>Stiff coarse focus cured by oil behind brass planetary gearcase.
<li>Broken polymer fine focus pinion gear -&gt; replaced by brass.<br>
<li>Stiff condenser focus.
<li>quintuple RMS objective turret better than separately purchased item.
<li>Otherwise in better condition than <a href="#2022">2022 Optiphot</a> incorrectly advertised as Labophot.
<li>Sticking meter movement provoked swapping electronics chassis with older Optiphot's.
