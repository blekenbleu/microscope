<h2>Infinity objectives comparisons by transmitted illumination<br>
	 thru Optiphot 100 Universal Epi Illuminator</h2>

<details><summary><font color=green size=+1><b>background</b></font></summary>
While primary microscopy interests involve incident illumination,<br>
calibration slides want transmitted illumination.

<p>When I started, nice used AO Series 10 were plentiful at relatively low cost,<br>
with the U.S. medical industry replacing them (mostly by Olympus microscopes).<br>
While Olympus MSPlan objectives were considered the hot setup for microscopy without coverslips,<br>
I scored at lower cost a set of MEIJI S.PlanM objectives,<br>
which sufficed for magnified image digital processing experiments.</p>

All other things being equal, better results obtain from simpler configurations<br>
(e.g. finite objectives directly projecting to camera sensors),<br>
but modern high quality metallurgical objectives are more often infinity.<br>
While Nikon CFI60 objectives are well-regarded,<br>
they are expensive and I lack compatible nosepiece turrets.

<p>Meanwhile, other modern infinity objectives have RMS threads,<br>
with at least Nikon BE and those from Olympus requiring no corrections.</p></details>
