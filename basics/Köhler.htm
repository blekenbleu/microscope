<h3></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6hler_illumination">K&ouml;hler illumination: &nbsp;lamp, field diaphragm and condenser alignment</a></h3>
Any number of websites will waste space pointing out how important it is,<br>
then provide miserable, incomplete and wrong instructions.<br>
K&ouml;hler alignment simply means getting filament focused on objective back focal plane,<br>
 which will also be in focus at condenser aperture and defocused at object plane.<br>
Fortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6hler_illumination">Wikipedia</a> does all right.<br>
<br>

K&ouml;hler as described most places is NOT about even illumination;<br>
using the condenser to focus and center the field aperture,<br>
then tweaking condenser iris in the objective back focal plane,<br>
is about <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/microscopy-basics/conjugate-planes-in-optical-microscopy">conjugate focal planes</a> and minimizing stray light to optimize contrast.<br>
<a href="http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artdec17/go-kohler.html">The "Hidden" Assumption of K&ouml;hler Illumination</a><br>
An illuminated ground glass can provide more planar and even illumination<br>
 than can implementing K&ouml;hler with incandescent filaments.<br>
<br>
I did not have K&ouml;hler issues 20 years ago with my AO Series 10,<br>
because frosted illuminator and neither field nor condenser diaphragm.<br>

<br>
Focusing a lamp filament (or LED equivalent)
on the condenser iris (or conjugate objective back focal plane)<br>
consequently maximizes illumination ray parallelism in the image plane.<br>
Without a centering telescope or Bertrand lens, my old eyes can better focus that lamp filament<br>
on a ground glass over the field lens port, NOT on condenser iris.<br>
For illumination port ground glass and condenser iris to be parfocal<br>
seemingly implies parallel rays between the field lens and condenser... NOT:<br>

<i><b>Note</b></i>:&nbsp; the above image oversimplifies Nikon illumination optics,<br>
 &emsp; which include a field lens between <b>Aperture Diaphragm</b> and <b>Condenser</b>.<br>
<br>
For my Nikon Optiphot with the swing-out 0.90 condenser,<br>
field aperture cannot be focused on the image plane<br>
when my epi stage plate is in place...<br>
The ELWD 0.3 condenser has no problem focusing the field aperture<br>
with epi stage plate spacing slides 4mm higher from it...<br>
<br>
Perhaps the Optiphot-66 stage and swing-out condenser will be parfocal.<br>
<br>
AO Series 120 has appropriate apertures and removable lamp diffuser:<br>
.. but weirdly labels filament focus knob as "Condenser"<br>
 &nbsp; because illumination condenser, which most others call "collector".<br>
<br>
Focusing the filament using ground glass on the field illumination port is easy,<br>
but on AO 120 corresponds neither with apparent focus at object back plane<br>
nor smoothest illumination,<br> which two do seem to better correspond,
but change among objectives.<br>
Condenser top swing is wanted for AO objectives less than 10x.<br>
Objective back focal plane filament focus issues were discussed
<a href="https://www.microbehunter.com/microscopy-forum/viewtopic.php?p=124034">here at MicrobeHunter.com</a>.<br>
The solution, as prompted by viktor j nilsson, was to disassemble and clean its Bertrand insert.<br>
<br>
A centering telescope is want for the Optiphots, particularly considering that one condenser lacks an aperture<br>
and wants dialing in a phase turret repurposed for dark field.

<p>Optiphot field lens focuses Universal EPI illuminator LHS-H100P-1 lamp filament on ground glass,
<br>changing distance between lamp housing collector lens and field lens
<br>does not much affect field lens to ground glass focus distance (135mm),
<br>suggesting lamp housing collector lens rays are substantially collimated...
<br>but Optiphot 150 illuminator lamp house extension has a lens...???</p>
