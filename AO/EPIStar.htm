Initial stylus image capture employs a 10x epi microscope objective with darkfield illumination<br> and Olympus NFK 3.3x projection ocular into a Canon EOS sensor.<br>
To hold the stylus at ~45 degrees, the cartridge was mounted in a headshell<br>
with no finger lift and clamped at the bayonet connector using a clothespin:

Although it facilitates sorting spacing between camera sensor and objectives, a bellows is not necessary;<br>
 extension tubes suffice, with more length yielding greater magnification.<br>
The resulting image has decent resolution, but poor contrast.<br>

This microscope has short working distance objectives; <br>
the 20x objective would not clear this stylus' plastic grip at this angle.<br>
90 degree shots will clear but require image stacking; <br>
whether objective darkfield illumination will then
highlight stylus wear spots remains to be seen.<br>

<a name="EPICONTRAST"><h3>EPIStar contrast</h3></a>
To investigate low contrast, <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?p=1034041#p1034041">Ray Parkhurst</a> suggested
removing the camera and looking down into the tube.<br>
<img src="Images/EyetubeSpot.jpg" align=center> <br clear=all>
Internal surfaces were not reflecting appreciable light,<br>
but a small bright spot and dim blob are seen in the optic at the bottom of the eye tube.<br><br>
Lacking ground glass, wax paper was laid over the camera adapter:<br>

The dim blob is revealed as the projected stylus.<br>
The bright spot appears less focused than when viewed directly and,<br>
 depending on viewing angle,
more or less distinct from the projected stylus image.<br><br>
<table><tr><td>
Removing the microscope head and looking down into the arm<br>
reveals a bright spot centered in an epi illuminator lens<br>
in a port off to one side<br>
as well as a less bright spot on the lower lip of that port.<br>
That <i>very</i> bright area below the epi lens is the brightfield mirror.

An A.O. #3002 image erector spaces the head further from the epi illuminator<br>
and slightly improved contrast, despite adding magnifying optics in the path:<br>

Infinity objectives can be used with a camera lens focused @ infinity,<br>
in this case, a Reichert EPIStar 10x<br>
 with Canon EF-S 55-250mm STM zoomed to 250mm.<br>
This is an example of camera telephoto as tube lens.<br><br>

To prevent this zoom from collapsing to 55mm,<br>
 the camera body needs support.<br>
Fortunately, focus is internal.
Some observations:<ul compact>
<li>EPIStar darkfield illumination wants alignment
<li>Kenko 1.4x TELEPLUS <b>HD DGX</b> reportedly works with this lens,<br>
but Kenko TELEPLUS <b>PRO 300</b> <i>does not</i>.<br>
About 50% more focal length is wanted to eliminate vignette:<br>
<img align=left src="Images/epi10x250mm640.jpg"><br clear=left><br>
<li>monochromatic illumination or fully corrected objective is wanted. &nbsp
