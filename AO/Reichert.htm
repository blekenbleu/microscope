<h2>Camera sensor direct projection<br> from AO/Reichert tube lens</h2>

<details><summary><font color=green size=+1><b>background</b></font></summary>
Having sorted that Biophot/Metaphot, Eclipse and AO/Reichert heads<br>
have roughly compatible circular dovetails,<br>
a next question is how compatible are various infinity objects and tube lenses.

<p>When I started, nice used AO Series 10 were plentiful at relatively low cost,<br>
with the U.S. medical industry replacing them (mostly by Olympus microscopes).<br>
I scored a cheap set of <a href=index.html#MEIJI>MEIJI S.PlanM</a> objectives,<br>
which sufficed for magnified image digital processing experiments,<br>
although Olympus SPlan M objectives were more popular.</p>

All other things being equal, better results obtain from simpler configurations<br>
(e.g. finite objectives directly projecting to camera sensors),<br>
but modern high quality metallurgical objectives are more often infinity.<br>
While Nikon CFI60 objectives are well-regarded,<br>
they are expensive and I lack compatible nosepiece turrets.

<p>Meanwhile, other modern infinity objectives have RMS threads,<br>
with at least Nikon BE and those from Olympus requiring no corrections.</p>

To minimize photo tube vignetting and obtain camera parfocality,<br>
a plastic drain tube section fits <i>outside</i> the photo port,<br>
using Reichert trinocular head's second screw hole,<div align=center>

not found on similar AO heads:<br>

<p>Friction tape reduces slack between photo port o.d. and drain tube i.d.:

Sandpaper removed glaze inside drain tube,<br>
then matte black sprayed to attenuate stray light:<br>

<p>A generic M42 extension tube fits over the drain tube.<br>
Parfocality employs an <a href=../../helicoid.htm>M42 focusing helicoid</a>,<br>
first roughly set by projecting calibration slide on ground glass:<br>
