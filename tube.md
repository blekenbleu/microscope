### Tube lens  
  *[back](index.html)*

Microscopes orignally used finite optics;  
relatively simple lenses which focus parallel (infinity) rays to a point  
may be repurposed for converging rays on either side, becoming finite.

Over 100 years ago, compound microscope objective lenses were optimized  
for finite focal distances on both sides (*Case iv*),  
often with a so-called tube length (*B'*) of 160mm.  

However, there are any number of useful accessories  
which get inserted between objectives and oculars, increasing tube length.  
Rather than changing objectives, such an accessory inserts *another* lens  
that modifies objective rays to refocus at the increased distance.  
Reflected light (episcopic) finite microscopes,  
which insert a beamsplitter for illuminating opaque objects,  
are typically designed for longer tube length (e.g. 210mm for Nikon).  
Alternatively, infinity objectives' foci are largely unaffected  
by changes in distance to so-called tube lens,  
which converts infinity rays back to finite  
for oculars that in turn set focus distance for observers' eyes.  
A camera lens of appropriate focal length can serve as a tube lens,  
provided that infinity objectives are fully corrected.

Using another lens to obtain virtual images from parallel rays
is called [afocal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afocal_system),  
and that term is also applied for [Afocal photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afocal_photography),  
where rays from oculars to observers' eyes are nominally parallel,  
![afocal ray diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Afocal_photography.png/350px-Afocal_photography.png)  
with observer replaced by a camera with lens focused near infinity.  
This camera can alternatively be inserted in place of an infinity scope's tube lens.  

A camera lens' focal length determines overall image size / magnification.  
A [40mm lens](M48.htm#pancake) typically fills an APS-C sensor when focused over a 10X microscope ocular.  
When replacing an infinity microscope's tube lens,  
longer camera focal lengths (e.g. 140-200mm) are typically wanted.
