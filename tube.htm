<h3>Tube lens</h3>

Microscopes orignally used finite optics;<br>
relatively simple lenses which focus parallel (infinity) rays to a point<br>
may be repurposed for converging rays on either side, becoming finite.<br>

Over 100 years ago, compound microscope objective lenses were optimized<br>
for finite focal distances on both sides (*Case iv*),<br>
often with a so-called tube length (*B'*) of 160mm.<br><br>

However, any number of useful accessories<br>
may get inserted between objectives and oculars, increasing tube length.<br>
Rather than changing objectives, such accessories insert *another* lens<br>
to refocus objective rays at the increased distance.<br>
Reflected light (episcopic) finite microscopes,<br>
which insert a beamsplitter for illuminating opaque objects,<br>
are typically designed for longer tube length (e.g. 210mm for Nikon).<br>
Alternatively, rays from infinity objectives, not being focussed, are relatively unaffected<br>
by changes in distance to so-called <i><b>tube lens</b></i>,<br>
which converts infinity rays back to finite<br>
for oculars that in turn set focus distance for observers' eyes.<br>
A camera lens of appropriate focal length can serve as a tube lens,<br>
provided that infinity objectives are fully corrected.<br>

Using another lens to obtain virtual images from parallel rays
is called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afocal_system><i><b>afocal</b></i></a>,<br>
and that term is also applied for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afocal_photography>Afocal photography</a>,<br>
where rays from oculars to observers' eyes are nominally parallel,<br><div align=center>
<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Afocal_photography.png/350px-Afocal_photography.png></div><br>
with observer replaced by a camera with lens focused near infinity.<br>
This camera can alternatively be inserted in place of an infinity scope's tube lens.<br><br>

A camera lens' focal length determines overall image size / magnification.<br>
A <a href=M48.htm#pancake>40mm lens</a> focused over a 10X microscope ocular typically fills an APS-C sensor,<br>
depending on objectives' field diameters.<br>
To replace an infinity microscope objective's tube lens,<br>
a telephoto camera lens (e.g. 100-200mm) is typically wanted.<br><br>
