First Surface Mirror GLASS for Kaleidoscopes, telescopes, periscopes, art projects - Front Surface Mirror<br>
Provides a true reflection with no double image<br><br>

155mm x 69mm x 2mm<br>
2-47/64" x 6-3/32" x 5/64"<br>
5/64" or 2mm Thick GLASS<br><br>  

Superior accuracy for engineering and scientific projects, as well as art projects<br><br>  

A first surface mirror or front surface mirror is a mirror with the reflective surface being above a backing,<br>  
as opposed to the conventional, second surface mirror<br>  
with the reflective surface behind a transparent substrate such as glass.<br><br>  

This first surface mirror has an 15/64" or 2mm glass substrate.<br>  

This was pulled from a high quality display system, and were isolated from contact with any outside contact,<br>
so there is ZERO wear, ZERO scratches, and entire surface is perfect.<br> 
They have not been cleaned at all since they were installed, so there may be a thin film of dust on them,<br>
but I will leave the cleaning to you.&nbsp If you are not particular,<br>
a bit of household glass cleaner and non-abrasive wiping cloth will clean these up in 5 seconds.<br> 
For the more particular, a bit of isopropyl and a lint-free wiping cloth will do the job quickly also.<br>
