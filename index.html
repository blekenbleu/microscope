<h3>Microscope Stylus Images</h3>
<h3>Background</h3>
Photomicrography and macro photography are both popular subjects in the InterWeb,<br>
including among better writers than I.<br>  Consequently, content here will focus (heh) on specific experiences,<br>
rather than more general theory and technique,
which for macro photography see e.g. <a href="https://www.allanwallsphotography.com/blog/zereneorheliconpt1">Allan Walls</a>.<br><br>
Years ago, I saw and admired <a href="https://www.micrographia.com/projec/projapps/viny/viny0300.htm">Micrographia</a>
and more recently <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=92996">Ray Parkhurst</a>'s <a href="http://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=44329">work</a><br>
 including contributions to vinylengine.com <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=112532">Stylus images on the not cheap (but not massively expensive)</a>.<br>
Capturing images of phonograph needles combines 3 of my long-time interests:<br>
audio, photography, and microscopy, although mostly microscopes with cameras.<br><br>

While not aspiring to create aesthetically pleasing images,<br>
facilitating capture of clear and useful phono stylus image wear images seems achievable.<br>
 Ray demonstrated that <a href="Nikon/">Nikon</a>'s <a href="https://krebsmicro.com/mplan.pdf">long working distance <a href=Nikon/Metaphot/#CF"><b>CF</b></a> objectives</a> are well-suited to this,<br>
while I already owned American Optical (AO) microscopes lacking long working distance objectives.<br>

<h3>Generalities</h3>
Microscopes traditionally shared some mechanical conventions:
<ul compact>
<li>RMS (Royal Microscope Society) Objective threads
<li>23.2 o.d. eyepiece (ocular) tubes
<li>160mm "tube length"
</ul>
Consequently, optically-matched objectives and oculars could be swapped among frames.<br>
Practically, after frames evolved from straight tubes to separate heads with prisms,<br>
additional lenses might be introduced, specifically to allow for e.g. vertical illuminators<br>
and/or polarizing filters to be inserted into optical paths.<br>
These optics are typically optimized for some manufacturer's objectives optical formula.<br>
Most modern microscopes use other than RMS threads; <a href="http://www.photomacrography.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=11710">here is a list</a>.<br>
<a href="https://agenaastro.com/articles/guides/astronomy-threads-explained.html">Here is a list of threads used in astronomy</a>.<br>

</ul>
Attaching microscope objectives directly to cameras is considered macro photography,<br>
rather than photomicroscopy, and will mostly be addressed elsewhere.<br>
However, attaching a camera body to a microscope body<br>
with nothing but air between objective and sensor
is generally considered photomicroscopy.<br>
This works with so-called finite objectives.<br>
<br>
Infinity objectives want a so-called <a href=tube>tube lens</a> to make rays finite,<br>
either for oculars or directly focusing on a sensor,<br>
in which case that tube lens may be a telescopic camera lens focused at infinity.<br>
Since some infinity microscopes depend on their tube lens
to correct objective aberrations,<br>
projection from infinity microsope's tube lens to camera's sensor may be considered<br>
 equivalent to direct projection from fully corrected finite objectives.<br>
AO pioneered infinity microscope production in the U.S.. &nbsp;
<a href="https://www.microbehunter.com/microscopy-forum/viewtopic.php?t=14662">(read here for more history)</a><br>
Practically, optical magnifications much over 1x<br>
wants technique and patience (or great image stabilization) for hand-held macrophotography.<br>
For inanimate opaque subjects, hand-holding has few advantages.<br>
<br>
<a name="DIA">
Opaque object microscopy requires reflective, rather than transmissive, illumination.<br>
This is called <i>episcopic</i> (contrasted to <i>diascopic</i>) with illumination accomplished either by<br>
external illumination sources or using so-called vertical illumination built into microscopes,<br>
where light may be directed down thru objectives, e.g. using prisms or other partial mirrors<br>
and called brightfield, or coaxially around objectives, called darkfield illumination.<br></a>
<br>
Most conventional (diascopic biological) microscopes can be used with external illumination<br>
for some opaque microscopy, but their objectives are optimized for viewing thru glass slide covers,<br>
which becomes increasingly important for higher N.A. objectives, e.g. more than 10-20x.<br>
<br>
<h3>Live View, focus bracketing, Abbe</h3>
Using a digital camera with zoomed Live View eases focusing.<br>
Beyond convenience, best viewfinder focus with DSLR mirror down may differ that on sensor.<br>
Silent shutter (Canon's mode 2) and <a href="RS60E3.htm">remote shutter release</a> minimize vibration during exposures.<br>
Replacing halogen illumination with blue LEDs should improve image resolution;<br>
<a href=basics/#MT>Raleigh's criterion</a> has Abbe diffraction limit<br>
 depend on illumination wavelength and <a href=basics/#NA>Numerical Aperture (N.A.)</a>.<br>
Practically, blue LEDs not only have shorter wavelengths than do red and green;
<br>excluding longer wavelengths also usefully reduces chromatic aberration effects.
<br>
However, blue sensors are relatively sparse in digital cameras;&nbsp  higher sensor resolution compensates.<br>
used Canon DSLRs with Live View and silent shutter (e.g. 50D) can be less than $100.<br>
Even better, <a href="https://builds.magiclantern.fm/"><b>free Magic Lantern firmware</b></a> adds
<https://builds.magiclantern.fm/features.html>focus stacking for many such cameras</a>.<br><br>

<b>other considerations</b><br>
For popular Olympus finite microscopes (e.g. BH2), matching relay lens is wanted<br>
 for objective aberration corrections, then DSLR is satisfactory.<br><br>

If direct projection (without relay lens) is wanted
for most infinity (excepting e.g. Leica)<br> and e.g. Nikon CF finite objectives,
 DSLR (e.g. T3i) greater flange-to-sensor distance<br>
cannot be parfocal on many trinocular heads.<br><br>

Used Canon EOS-M series camera bodies with > 20mp sensors can < US$200.<br>
Canon's tether utility is IMO more useful than those of other manufacturers.<br><br>

Few Canon EF-M models offer focus stacking,
applicable for afocal configurations<br> with a supported autofocus lens.<br><br>

Some (more modern) EOS RF bodies are now available used for < US$400,<br>
but I lack experience with them.<br><br>

Sony mirrorless bodies can more often be powered by USB than can Canon;<br>
Sony full-frame bodies typically have built-in APS-C crop mode, unlike Canon,<br>
but Sony's slightly larger than Canon APS-C sensor size is more liable to corner vignetting.

<a name=EYECLAMP><h2>Eye tube camera adapter clamps</h2></a>
<a name=M25>Traditional eyepiece tubes have about 25mm o.d.,<br>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082HC7DYY"><font

<img width=860 src="telescope/extensions.jpg"><br clear=all>
	<i>photo relay instead of eyepiece, then extension tubes and helicoid to focus on camera sensor</i><br><br>
... perhaps with shims to fill gap between eye tube o.d. and clamp i.d.:
<image align=middle src="telescope/shim.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
Eye tube adapters with typical T2 or M42 threads
require camera-specific adapters.<br>
A projection ocular and extension tubes should cost less than $100;<br>
monocular microscope heads typically cost much less than trinoculars,<br>
while having less light loss than binocular heads,<br>
and used eye tube camera adapter clamps go for around $15.<br><br>

Good complete used microscope

<a name=AO10NFK><h4>A.O. 10X with NFK 3.3X</h4></a>
With an AO head, AO objectives are substantially corrected, better matching a Nikon CF PL relay lens.<br>
Headless, an NFK relay lens approximates AO tube lens corrections.<br>
Finding the stylus with a microscope objective is easier using conventional oculars<br>
 than with camera Live View and relay lens.<br>
Since the head has an infinity tube lens, this requires infinity objectives.<br>
Since Series 10 AO Spencers often include a 10X objective, how well does one work on a stylus?<br>
Because they are smaller in diameter than MEIJI and Leitz objectives<br>
for which cardstock half-cylinders were epoxied to LED halos, a shim was cut from clear vinyl tubing.<br>
<img src="Images/AO10Xshim.jpg"><br clear=all>
This particular objective appears to have about 4mm working distance.<br>
With halo illumination, a stylus tip is better illuminated with cartridge vertical centerline<br>
rotated more nearly 60 than 45 degrees from horizontal, reducing surface in focus.
<p>
With NFK 3.3X relay lens and about 200mm projection distance,<br>
full field of view with APS-C sensor is usefully in focus;<br>
both of these images (downsampled, but not cropped) were captured after central focusing (zoomed Live View):<br>
