<em>20W USB-C 10,000mAh AC charger and portable power bank</em></p>

<p>This will be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to power macro lens LED light portably</li>
  <li>to power cameras attached to microscopes</li>
</ul>

<p>That push button on the side has 8 tinly LEDs to show status;<br />
they are visible only when viewed nearly squarely,<br />
so NOT looking down at an angle when it is plugged in an outlet low on walls.</p>

<p>To work with a (Canon M6 II) dummy battery:</p>
<ul>
  <li>first insert dummy battery into the camera,</li>
  <li>connect the dummy battery to this Anker power bank,</li>
  <li>turn on the camera,</li>
  <li>THEN plug Anker into AC.</li>
  <li>Otherwise (turning on camera <em>after</em> pluggin Anker into AC),<br />
Anker defaults to recharge mode and does NOT supply power to the camera.</li>
</ul>

<p>Press the button twice to set trickle charge mode - green dot lights.<br />
Press twice again to disable trickle charge mode.</p>

<p>USB-C port is output only;  charging is only by AC.<br />
AC charging rate is 16 Watts.<br />
A device can be charging at up to 4 Watts while the bank is plugged in,<br />
with the bank being charged at 16watts.<br />
A device pulling more than 4 Watts disables bank recharging.<br />
USB A port device is prioritized over USB-C;<br />
Combined power exceeding 20 Watts disables the USB C.<br />
USB-C port alone max is 9V 2A;  limit with both ports is 5V.</p>
