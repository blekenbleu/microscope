 their apertures are closer to the front of the lens,

Many USB camera sensors are quite small;<br>
while a reduction lens avoids excessive intermediate image cropping,<br>
IMO undoing microscope objective magnification is "<i>not ideal</i>".

Attaching finite microscope objectives directly to camera bodies<br> is <i>generally</i> considered macro photography,

Lenses for use at 4-5X on an APS-sized sensor</a> - rjlittlefield</ul>

<p>Attaching a camera body to a microscope with only air between <a href=basics/index.html#OBJ>finite objective</a> and sensor<br>
is generally considered photomicroscopy and often called 'direct projection'.
<br>
Infinity objectives want a <a href=tube.htm>tube lens</a> to make rays finite,<br>
either for oculars or directly focusing on a sensor,<br>
in which case that tube lens may be a telescopic camera lens focused at infinity.<br>
Since some infinity microscopes depend on their tube lens
to correct objective aberrations,<br>
projection from infinity microsope's tube lens to camera's sensor may be considered<br>
 equivalent to direct projection from fully corrected finite objectives.<br>
AO pioneered infinity microscope production in the U.S.. &nbsp;
<a href="https://www.microbehunter.com/microscopy-forum/viewtopic.php?t=14662">(read here for more history)</a><br>
Practically, optical magnifications much over 1x<br>
wants technique and patience (or great image stabilization) for hand-held macrophotography.<br>
For inanimate opaque subjects, hand-holding has few advantages.</p>

<a name=DIA>
Opaque object microscopy requires incident, rather than transmissive, illumination.<br>
This is called <i>episcopic</i> (contrasted to <i>diascopic</i>) with illumination accomplished either by<br>
external illumination sources or using so-called vertical illumination built into microscopes,<br>
where light may be directed down thru objectives, e.g. using prisms or other partial mirrors<br>
and called brightfield, or coaxially around objectives, called darkfield illumination.</a>

<p>Typical (diascopic biological) microscopes can used external illumination for opaque microscopy,<br>
but objectives optimized for coverslips become increasingly problematic<br>
 at higher <a href=basics/index.html#NA>Numeric Apertures</a> and shorter working distances.</p>

<h3>Live View, focus bracketing, Abbe</h3>
Using a digital camera with zoomed Live View eases focusing.<br>
Beyond convenience, best viewfinder focus with DSLR mirror down may differ that on sensor.<br>
Silent shutter (Canon's mode 2) and <a href="RS60E3.htm">remote shutter release</a> minimize vibration during exposures.<br>
Replacing halogen illumination with blue LEDs should improve image resolution;<br>
<a href=basics/#MT>Raleigh's criterion</a> has Abbe diffraction limit<br>
 depend on illumination wavelength and <a href=basics/#NA>Numerical Aperture (N.A.)</a>.<br>
Practically, blue LEDs not only have shorter wavelengths than do red and green;
<br>excluding longer wavelengths also usefully reduces chromatic aberration effects.
<br>
However, blue sensors are relatively sparse in digital cameras;&nbsp  higher sensor resolution compensates.<br>
Used Canon APS-C bodies with Live View and silent shutter
(<a href=https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=canon+50d&_sacat=0&LH_Complete=1&LH_Sold=1&_sop=15&rt=nc&LH_ItemCondition=3000>e.g. 50D) can be less than $100</a>.<br>
<a href="https://builds.magiclantern.fm/"><b>Free Magic Lantern firmware</b></a> adds
<https://builds.magiclantern.fm/features.html>focus stacking to many such cameras</a>.<br><br>

<b>other considerations</b><br>
For popular Olympus finite microscopes (e.g. BH2), matching relay lens is wanted<br>
 for objective aberration corrections, then DSLR is satisfactory.<br><br>

If direct projection (without relay lens) is wanted
for most infinity (excepting e.g. Leica)<br> and e.g. Nikon CF finite objectives,
 DSLR (e.g. T3i) greater flange-to-sensor distance<br>
cannot be parfocal on many trinocular heads.<br><br>

Used Canon EOS-M series camera bodies with > 20mp sensors can < US$200.<br>
Canon's tether utility is IMO more useful than those of other manufacturers.<br><br>

Few Canon EF-M models offer focus stacking,
applicable for afocal configurations<br> with a supported autofocus lens.<br><br>

Some (more modern) EOS RF bodies are now available used for < US$400,<br>
but I lack experience with them.<br><br>

<a href=../static/A7II/index.html>Sony mirrorless bodies</a> can more often be powered by USB than can Canon;<br>
Sony full-frame bodies typically have built-in APS-C crop mode, unlike Canon,<br>
but Sony's slightly larger than Canon APS-C sensor size is more liable to corner vignetting.

	<i>instead of eyepiece, photo relay, extension tubes and helicoid to focus projection on camera sensor</i><br><br>
... perhaps with shims to fill gap between eye tube o.d. and clamp i.d.:
<image align=middle src="telescope/shim.jpg"><br clear=all><br>
Eye tube adapters with typical T2 or M42 threads
require camera-specific adapters.<br>
A projection ocular and extension tubes should cost less than $100;<br>
monocular microscope heads typically cost much less than trinoculars,<br>
while having less light loss than binocular heads,<br>
and used eye tube camera adapter clamps go for around $15.<br><br>

Good complete used microscope
with epi illumination and bright/darkfield objectives can be spendy.<br>
